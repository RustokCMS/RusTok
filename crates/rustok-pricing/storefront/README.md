# rustok-pricing-storefront

## Purpose

`rustok-pricing-storefront` provides the module-owned Leptos storefront route for
public pricing discovery.

## Responsibilities

- Render the public pricing atlas for published catalog entries.
- Read pricing summary and variant-level price data through native `#[server]`
  functions backed by `rustok-pricing::PricingService`.
- Surface effective variant pricing from the typed resolver when the route carries
  optional pricing context query values such as `currency`, `region_id`,
  `price_list_id`, `channel_id` / `channel_slug`, and `quantity`.
- Surface normalized `discount_percent` for sale rows and effective prices so
  storefront pricing UI does not have to derive sale math from `compare_at`
  fields on its own.
- Surface active tenant-scoped price lists and available channels as pricing-owned
  selectors when the route already carries an effective pricing context.
- Surfaces `seller_id` in pricing cards as the language-neutral seller boundary;
  `vendor` remains a catalog merchandising label and is not used for ownership.
- Links back to the product storefront module with `handle` when available,
  keeping display labels out of the pricing-owned route state.
- Keep the existing GraphQL storefront contract as a parallel fallback path; the
  fallback now also reads `storefrontPricingChannels` and
  `storefrontActivePriceLists(channelId, channelSlug)` from the commerce facade so
  channel-aware selector state stays aligned when native server functions are not
  available, and uses `storefrontPricingProduct` to keep variant-level
  `effective_price` parity for explicit pricing context.
- Validate pricing resolution context consistently before GraphQL fallback and
  across native `#[server]` handlers: `currency_code` must be a three-letter
  ASCII code, `quantity` must be at least `1`, and `region_id`,
  `price_list_id`, or `quantity` require explicit currency; malformed explicit
  `channel_id` is rejected instead of falling back to host channel context.
- Consume the host-provided effective locale from `UiRouteContext` and resolve selected pricing-card copy against that locale before falling back to another translation.
