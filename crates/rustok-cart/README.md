# rustok-cart

## Purpose

`rustok-cart` is the default cart submodule of the `Ecommerce` family.

## Responsibilities

- Own the cart write-side schema and line item lifecycle.
- Keep cart snapshots independent from catalog ownership.
- Prepare a stable handoff point for later checkout and order placement flows.

## Interactions

- Depends on `rustok-core` for module contracts.
- Used by `rustok-commerce` as the default cart submodule of the ecommerce family.
- Keeps product and variant references as snapshots so the cart domain does not depend on
  the product module as a lower-level shared layer.

## Entry points

- `CartModule`
- `CartService`
- `dto::*`
- `entities::*`
