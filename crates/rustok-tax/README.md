# rustok-tax

## Purpose

`rustok-tax` is the default tax-domain foundation for the commerce family.

## Responsibilities

- Own the tax calculation contract and provider seam instead of leaving tax
  runtime hardcoded inside cart or checkout services.
- Provide a default `region_default` provider that preserves the current
  region-based `tax_rate` / `tax_included` behavior while exposing a stable
  provider boundary for future external tax engines.
- Select the active provider through the current region policy hook
  `regions.tax_provider_id`, rejecting unknown providers instead of
  silently falling back.
- Keep tax-line snapshots provider-aware through a typed `provider_id`
  contract.

## Interactions

- Used by `rustok-cart` as the source of truth for cart tax calculation.
- Snapshot output flows through `rustok-commerce` checkout into `rustok-order`.
- Does not own storefront or admin transport yet; transport remains in
  `rustok-commerce` while the domain seam stabilizes.

## Entry points

- `TaxModule`
- `TaxService`
- `TaxCalculationInput`
- `TaxCalculationResult`
