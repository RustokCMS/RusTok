# rustok-product-admin

Leptos admin UI package for the `rustok-product` module.

## Responsibilities

- Exposes the product catalog admin root view used by `apps/admin`.
- Keeps product list/create/edit/publish/archive workflow inside the product-owned package.
- Participates in manifest-driven admin composition through `rustok-module.toml`.
- Uses registry-backed shipping-profile selection so catalog operators work with typed product bindings instead of raw slug text.
- Ships package-owned `admin/locales/en.json` and `admin/locales/ru.json` bundles declared through `[provides.admin_ui.i18n]`.

## Entry Points

- `ProductAdmin` - root admin view rendered from the host admin registry.

## Interactions

- Consumed by `apps/admin` via manifest-driven `build.rs` code generation.
- Uses the `rustok-commerce` GraphQL contract for product CRUD while ownership moves to module-owned UI.
- Treats `product -> variants.prices` as a catalog compatibility snapshot and now
  renders pricing-authoritative preview through a separate `adminPricingProduct`
  hook instead of presenting catalog snapshot rows as resolved prices.
- Links directly into `rustok-pricing/admin` with prefilled product id and
  pricing context so operators can move from catalog editing to pricing control
  without reselecting the product.
- Accepts product edit deep links through query `id=` so neighboring
  module-owned admin routes can return to the exact catalog item without using
  display fields as identity.
- Reads the effective UI locale from `UiRouteContext.locale`; product translation edits and edit-form hydration both resolve against that host-owned locale without a package-local locale override.
