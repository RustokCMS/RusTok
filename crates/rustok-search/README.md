# rustok-search

## Purpose

`rustok-search` owns product-facing search contracts for RusToK.

## Responsibilities

- Provide `SearchModule` metadata for the runtime registry.
- Define canonical search engine selection and connector metadata.
- Keep PostgreSQL as the default search engine contract.
- Own search settings persistence and future connector-facing runtime contracts.
- Own module-local `search_documents` storage and execute PostgreSQL FTS with `tsvector`,
  `websearch_to_tsquery`, `ts_rank_cd`, highlights, and facet aggregation.
- Serve as the home for storefront/admin/global-search capabilities, separate from `rustok-index`.

## Interactions

- Depends on `rustok-core` for module contracts.
- May ingest from domain tables or neutral read models, but keeps its own search storage and runtime.
- Content-document tag keywords/payload are now derived from `nodes.metadata.tags` during
  projection, not from legacy `taggables` joins.
- Is used by `apps/server` as a core platform capability.
- Publishes module-owned admin and storefront UI packages for host composition.
- Keeps external engine integrations behind dedicated connector crates, rather than forcing domain modules to talk to provider SDKs directly.

## Entry points

- `SearchModule`
- `SearchEngineKind`
- `SearchConnectorDescriptor`
- `SearchSettingsRecord`
- `PgSearchEngine`

## Capability matrix

| Capability | Primary surface | Consumer | Scope and guardrails |
|---|---|---|---|
| Public search results | `storefrontSearch` | Leptos/Next storefront | Tenant-scoped, read-only, published/public documents only |
| Public autocomplete | `storefrontSearchSuggestions` | Leptos/Next storefront | Tenant-scoped, read-only, same public visibility boundary as storefront search |
| Public click tracking | `trackSearchClick` | Storefront hosts | Best-effort analytics write for CTR/abandonment, no rebuild side effects |
| Admin search preview | `searchPreview` | Leptos/Next admin package | Authenticated tenant-scoped control-plane preview with filters/facets and ranking override |
| Host quick search | `adminGlobalSearch` | Leptos header search / Next KBar | Authenticated tenant-scoped quick-open surface, separate from preview telemetry |
| Diagnostics | `searchDiagnostics`, `searchLaggingDocuments`, `searchConsistencyIssues` | Admin/operators | Authenticated tenant-scoped operational inspection |
| Analytics | `searchAnalytics` | Admin/operators | Authenticated tenant-scoped query intelligence and slow-query analysis |
| Dictionaries and merchandising | `searchDictionarySnapshot` plus synonym/stop-word/pin-rule mutations | Admin/operators | Authenticated tenant-scoped control plane for normalization and exact-query pinning |
| Settings and rebuild control | `searchSettingsPreview`, `updateSearchSettings`, `triggerSearchRebuild` | Admin/operators | Authenticated tenant-scoped control plane; settings and rebuild actions emit audit events |

## Error catalog and validation policy

- `Validation`: caller input is rejected for unsupported engines or ranking profiles, unknown preset keys, malformed preset surfaces/keys/values, empty synonym or stop-word values, and empty query-rule targets. These are non-retriable caller bugs.
- `NotFound`: product-facing search remains read-only, but merchandising writes can fail when a pinned document is absent from `search_documents`. Operators should reindex or choose another target instead of retrying blindly.
- `Forbidden` / `Auth`: admin/control-plane surfaces require authenticated tenant-scoped access. Storefront search surfaces stay public and read-only.
- `Database` / `External`: projector and dictionary/runtime services require PostgreSQL. Storage failures or unsupported backends are operational failures, not validation errors.
- Search settings validation is centralized in `SearchSettingsService::save`, so raw JSON config and structured editors share the same checks for `ranking_profiles` and `filter_presets`.
- Ranking-profile surfaces accept only stable identifiers and only the built-in profiles `balanced`, `exact`, `fresh`, `catalog`, and `content`.
- Filter-preset surfaces accept only stable ASCII identifiers, normalize values to lowercase, and reject duplicates or oversized lists instead of silently truncating them.
- Query normalization trims whitespace, lowercases tokens, removes configured stop words, and expands tenant-owned synonym groups before PostgreSQL FTS execution.

## Current status

- Admin GraphQL exposes engine availability, effective settings preview, and an FTS-backed
  `searchPreview` surface with filters and facets.
- Admin GraphQL also exposes dedicated `adminGlobalSearch`, so host-level admin
  quick search does not get mixed into control-plane preview telemetry.
- Admin GraphQL and both admin packages now ship a real settings editor for
  `active_engine`, `fallback_engine`, and tenant-local JSON config persistence.
- Storefront GraphQL exposes public `storefrontSearch`, limited to published content/products.
- Search queries are read-only and no longer trigger bootstrap rebuilds on the request path.
- PostgreSQL search reads from `search_documents`, not from `rustok-index` tables.
- Search GraphQL now also exposes `searchDictionarySnapshot` plus admin mutations
  for synonyms, stop words, and exact-query pinned-result rules.
- Query rewrite now applies tenant-owned stop words and synonym expansion before
  PostgreSQL FTS execution, while exact-query pin rules can promote curated
  results on both admin preview and storefront search.
- `SearchIngestionHandler` updates `search_documents` asynchronously from domain events and supports rebuild requests.
- Search rebuilds now execute transactionally so operators do not see half-rebuilt tenant indexes.
- Admin GraphQL exposes `searchDiagnostics`, `searchLaggingDocuments`, and
  `triggerSearchRebuild` for lag/state inspection, raw stale-document diagnostics,
  and queued tenant-wide or scoped rebuilds.
- Admin diagnostics now also surface missing/orphaned projection counts and a
  raw `searchConsistencyIssues` feed, so operators can distinguish lag from
  true search/source drift.
- Admin GraphQL now also exposes `searchAnalytics` backed by module-local
  `search_query_logs`, including top queries and zero-result analysis.
- Search GraphQL now exposes `trackSearchClick`, and result payloads include
  `queryLogId` plus a best-effort target URL so CTR and abandonment can be
  measured from real result clicks.
- Search GraphQL now also exposes `storefrontSearchSuggestions`, backed by
  successful storefront query history and matching `search_documents` titles so
  autocomplete can stay on the same module-owned contract as full search.
- PostgreSQL search now applies typo-tolerant fallback over `pg_trgm` when the
  primary FTS pass returns zero hits, so minor misspellings can still surface
  relevant products and content without making fuzzy matching the default path.
- PostgreSQL search now also supports built-in ranking profiles (`balanced`,
  `exact`, `fresh`, `catalog`, `content`) with per-surface defaults from
  `search_settings.config.ranking_profiles`, and admin preview can override the
  profile explicitly for tuning work.
- Search GraphQL now enforces tenant-local scope and validates engine/filter input before execution.
- Search settings persistence now also validates `ranking_profiles` and
  `filter_presets` structure before saving, so raw JSON and structured editors
  go through the same backend contract.
- Public storefront search and suggestions now run behind a dedicated
  server-side rate limiter, and admin settings/rebuild actions emit best-effort
  audit events through the outbox.
- Search ingestion now runs with dispatcher retries, and diagnostics treat truly empty tenants as healthy instead of degraded.
- Prometheus telemetry now exposes query volume, latency, zero-result, indexing,
  fleet-level lag metrics, dedicated storefront rate-limit outcomes, and audit
  publication counters for `rustok-search`.
- Search analytics and admin dashboards now also surface slow-query rate and a
  dedicated slow-query leaderboard from `search_query_logs`.
- The module now ships a local observability runbook for rebuilds, lag triage,
  and `/metrics` interpretation.
- Leptos admin and storefront packages are wired to the live GraphQL search contract.
- The Leptos storefront package now ships a real query form and autocomplete
  dropdown that navigate through the same `?q=` route contract and public
  search/suggestions endpoints.
- The Leptos admin package now ships separate overview, playground, diagnostics,
  analytics, and dictionaries surfaces under the module route, including live
  settings, synonym/stop-word/pin-rule editors, CTR, abandonment, low-CTR,
  query-intelligence views, a structured relevance editor for ranking defaults
  and filter presets, and is also exposed as a first-class admin sidebar entry.
- The Leptos admin host now also uses `rustok-search` for header-level global
  admin search with module-aware quick navigation and a fallback into the full
  search control plane.
- The Next admin package mirrors the same control-plane surfaces and uses the same
  GraphQL contract for settings, diagnostics, analytics, click tracking,
  rebuilds, FTS preview, search dictionary management, and structured relevance
  settings.
- The Next admin host now wires `rustok-search` into KBar so global admin
  search and command-palette quick-open use the same search contract and
  analytics surface.
- The Next storefront package now mirrors the same live search and
  suggestions/autocomplete contract for parallel UI development.
