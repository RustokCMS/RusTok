# rustok-search implementation plan

## Purpose

This document is the canonical implementation roadmap for `rustok-search`.

It replaces the older central platform draft that previously lived in
`docs/modules/search-module-plan.md`. Search planning now lives with the actual
module code so architecture, runtime behavior, and rollout phases stay aligned.

## Objective

Build `rustok-search` as a dedicated core search module that:

- keeps search separate from `rustok-index`
- uses PostgreSQL as the default engine
- owns storefront and admin search surfaces
- evolves Leptos and Next UI in parallel on the same API contract
- supports optional external search connectors

## Architecture boundary

### `rustok-index`

`rustok-index` is responsible for:

- centralized index and read-model infrastructure
- ingestion and denormalized read models
- cross-module joins and filtering substrate
- rebuild, sync, and consistency workflows for index data

`rustok-index` is not responsible for:

- full-text search UX
- search ranking and relevance
- synonyms and stop words
- autocomplete and suggestions
- search analytics
- engine-specific search connectors

### `rustok-search`

`rustok-search` is responsible for:

- canonical search API and runtime contracts
- search document materialization
- query parsing and normalization
- ranking and relevance
- admin and storefront search UI
- global admin search
- search analytics and observability
- connector integration for external engines

## Runtime model

Preferred interaction model:

1. Domain modules emit changes.
2. `rustok-search` builds and updates its own `search_documents`.
3. Search UI and API talk only to `rustok-search`.
4. `rustok-search` may read from domain data directly and may optionally use
   neutral read models where that improves ingestion, but it does not depend on
   `rustok-index` as its canonical search storage.

Practical conclusion:

- `index` and `search` can cooperate, but they must not collapse into one module.
- `search -> index` can be allowed where useful.
- `index -> search` should remain forbidden.

## Engine strategy

### Default engine

PostgreSQL is the default and baseline engine:

- full-text search
- weighted `tsvector`
- `ts_rank` / `ts_rank_cd`
- `websearch_to_tsquery`
- `ts_headline`
- GIN indexes
- `pg_trgm`
- `unaccent`

### Optional engines

External engines should be delivered as dedicated optional connector crates:

- `rustok-search-meilisearch`
- `rustok-search-typesense`
- `rustok-search-algolia`

Recommended connector model:

- one connector per engine
- official SDK for each provider
- thin shared contract inside `rustok-search`
- engine selection through `rustok-search` settings

Why not a Laravel Scout style foundation:

- provider capabilities differ too much
- a single abstraction becomes either too weak or leaks provider behavior
- crate-based connectors fit the RusToK modular architecture better

## Engine selection UX

Expected operator experience:

1. A connector crate is added to the platform.
2. The connector registers capabilities and settings schema.
3. Search settings expose only actually installed engines.
4. `postgres` remains the default and fallback option.
5. Domain modules stay unaware of which engine is currently active.

## Current implementation checkpoint

Already implemented:

- dedicated `rustok-search` core module
- module-local `search_documents` storage
- module-local `search_query_logs` storage for persistent analytics
- module-local `search_query_clicks` storage for CTR and abandonment analysis

  storage for search dictionaries and merchandising rules
- PostgreSQL FTS runtime over `search_documents`
- canonical search contracts and settings persistence
- backend validation for `ranking_profiles` and `filter_presets`
- tenant-scoped GraphQL access and stricter search input validation
- async ingestion from content and product events
- queued rebuild flow for `search`, `content`, `product`, and optional target IDs
- transactional rebuild execution and dispatcher retries for ingestion safety
- Prometheus metrics for query volume, latency, zero-result rate, indexing
  outcomes, fleet-level lag/bootstrap visibility, storefront rate-limit
  outcomes, and audit-event publication status
- admin diagnostics via `searchDiagnostics`
- admin analytics via `searchAnalytics`
- admin dictionary snapshot via `searchDictionarySnapshot`
- admin CRUD mutations for synonyms, stop words, and exact-query pin rules
- live admin settings editor for active/fallback engine selection and JSON config

- local observability runbook for rebuilds, lag handling, and metrics
- ADR-backed boundary between `rustok-index` and `rustok-search`
- documented capability matrix and search-facing error/validation policy in the module README
- Leptos admin control plane with overview, playground, diagnostics, dictionaries
- Next admin control plane mirroring the same contract
- first-class sidebar entry in both Leptos admin and Next admin
- Leptos header-level global admin search wired to `adminGlobalSearch`
- Next KBar global admin search wired to `adminGlobalSearch`
- fallback hand-off from host-level quick search into the full search control plane

## Open questions

- Should any search ingestion paths still read from `rustok-index`, or should
  the module remain domain-event/domain-table first?
- Should synonyms and stop words be platform-level first, then tenant-level?
- When external engines are enabled, what degraded-mode UX should operators see?

## Documentation rules for this module

When architecture, API contracts, routing, tenancy behavior, observability, or
admin/storefront UI responsibilities change:

1. Update this file first.
2. Update `crates/rustok-search/README.md`.
3. Update `crates/rustok-search/docs/README.md` if the documentation map changes.
4. Update `docs/index.md` if central documentation links need to move.
