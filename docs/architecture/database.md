# RusToK Database Schema

> Current-state schema map for the main platform tables and major module-owned schemas.  
> Updated: 2026-04-05

This document is a high-level guide, not the canonical migration source. Source of truth remains:

- SeaORM entities under `apps/server/src/models/_entities` and module crates;
- migrations in `apps/server/migration` and module-owned migration sources;
- module docs for storage/index/workflow-specific schemas.

## Foundation Tables

## Multilingual Storage Contract

RusToK now treats multilingual storage as an explicit architecture contract, not a module-by-module convention.

The target pattern is:

- base business tables store only language-agnostic state;
- localized short text lives in parallel `*_translations` records;
- heavy localized content may live in dedicated `*_bodies` records keyed by owner + locale;
- tenant locale policy (`tenants.default_locale`, `tenant_locales`) controls effective locale selection and fallback, not physical ownership of localized fields;
- locale storage follows the same normalized BCP47-like contract as runtime and should use `VARCHAR(32)` as the platform-safe width.

This is already the live direction for platform foundation and content-family storage. Some older module slices still contain legacy mixed patterns and should be treated as migration targets, not as the desired end-state.

## RBAC Tables

RBAC source of truth remains relation tables:

- `roles`
- `permissions`
- `user_roles`
- `role_permissions`

These tables back the Casbin-only runtime through resolver/adapters; they remain authoritative for permission data.

---

## Content and Commerce Tables

### Content

Core content schema remains centered around:

- `nodes`
- `node_translations`
- `bodies`

This is the current canonical storage direction for multilingual content:

- `nodes` owns language-agnostic state;
- `node_translations` owns localized short text and metadata;
- `bodies` owns localized heavy content keyed by `(node_id, locale)`.

### Commerce

Core commerce schema remains centered around:

- `products`
- `product_translations`
- `product_variants`
- `variant_translations`
- `prices`
- `product_images`
- `product_options`

Commerce is still mid-migration in parts of the repo, but the platform target is the same: base entities stay language-agnostic, localized short text lives in `*_translations`, and rich localized content should not be privileged in base rows.

### Flex

`flex` is a capability / ghost-module slice, but it is not exempt from the multilingual storage contract.

Current live server-owned standalone storage is centered around:

- `flex_schemas`
- `flex_schema_translations`
- `flex_entries`
- `flex_attached_localized_values`

Current direction:

- `flex_schemas` owns language-agnostic schema state such as `slug`, `fields_config`, `settings`, and activation flags;
- `flex_schema_translations` owns localized schema copy such as `name` and `description`;
- `flex_attached_localized_values` owns attached-mode locale-aware field values by `(tenant_id, entity_type, entity_id, field_key, locale)` and its shared entity/helpers now live in `crates/flex`;
- `flex_entries` still stores flexible JSON payloads for entry values, but localized entry-value semantics are considered an explicit follow-up migration area rather than a final canonical multilingual shape.

Attached-mode `flex` field-definition localization currently still uses JSON locale maps in field-definition rows; this remains transitional and should converge toward parallel localized records in later slices.
Field-definition rows now also carry explicit `is_localized` semantics, so attached-mode custom fields no longer depend on an implicit convention when deciding whether future values belong to locale-aware parallel storage.
Live attached-value read/write paths now use `flex_attached_localized_values` for `user`, `product`, `order`, and `topic` locale-aware custom values. `topic` now uses `forum_topics.metadata` as the donor payload surface, so it follows the same attached multilingual contract instead of remaining a schema-only consumer. Legacy localized keys that still live inline in donor `metadata` are treated as transitional fallback data during read/update until dedicated backfill slices finish the migration and cleanup for already-live attached consumers.

## Index Tables

`rustok-index` owns the denormalized read models used by the CQRS read path.

### `index_content`

Implemented and maintained by content indexers.

Representative columns:

- `tenant_id`
- `node_id`
- `locale`
- `kind`
- `slug`
- `title`
- `excerpt`
- `search_vector`
- `indexed_at`

### `index_products`

Implemented and maintained by product indexers.

Representative columns:

- `tenant_id`
- `product_id`
- `locale`
- `handle`
- `title`
- `description`
- `price_min`
- `price_max`
- `attributes`
- `search_vector`
- `indexed_at`

---

## Workflow Tables

`rustok-workflow` owns its own module tables and they are implemented in the live schema:

- `workflows`
- `workflow_steps`
- `workflow_executions`
- `workflow_step_executions`
- `workflow_versions`

Notable runtime fields include:

- workflow trigger config (`trigger_config`)
- failure tracking (`failure_count`, `auto_disabled_at`)
- webhook trigger support (`webhook_slug`, `webhook_secret`)
- execution context and step I/O payloads (`context`, `input`, `output`)

---

## Media and Storage

Media metadata is module-owned while file bytes are handled through the shared storage runtime.

Key media tables:

- `media`
- `media_translations`

Storage backend configuration is not modeled as per-file SQL schema; it is runtime-configured through typed settings and `platform_settings`.

---

## Notes

- `tenant_id` remains the primary isolation boundary for platform and module data.
- JSONB is used intentionally for module/platform settings, workflow configuration, and flexible metadata.
- JSONB is not the canonical long-term owner for multilingual business text when a module is under the parallel-localized-record migration path.
- Read-model tables are denormalized on purpose and should not be treated as authoritative write-side state.
- For exact column/index/constraint details, prefer module migrations and generated entities over this summary doc.
